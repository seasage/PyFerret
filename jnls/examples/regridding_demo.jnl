! This demonstration/tutorial will introduce FERRET regridding concepts.

! As the demonstration runs please continue to read the text on the screen.
! You will see exactly the commands that are controlling the FERRET program.
! Lines that begin with "!" are comment lines - no action is taken by FERRET.

! The explanatory text provided is quite brief.
! Further explanation is provided in the FERRET Users' Guide.

MESSAGE
SET WINDOW/size=1.5/ASPECT=.75:axis   ! default

! We begin by selecting the ETOPO data set: earth surface relief
! We will display some data over North America.
! Notice that the resolution of this particular data set is quite low.

SET DATA etopo120
SHADE/X=160W:40W/Y=20N:70N/palette=centered/level=c rose

message

! Higher-resolution datasets are available, but for this demonstration,
! we will define new axes and a new grid with finer resolution.
! We will then view the same data regridded to this new grid.
! FERRET regridding is controlled by "g=...".
! By default regridding is done via multi-linear interpolation.
! Note that interpolation may produce some undesirable effects
!      e.g. eliminating much of Florida.  

DEFINE AXIS/X=160W:40W:.5/UNIT=LONGITUDE xfine

DEFINE GRID/X=xfine/Y=yfine gfine
SHADE/X=160W:40W/Y=20N:70N/palette=centered/level=c  rose[g=gfine]

message The @AVE transformation improves this behavior in this instance

SHADE/X=160W:40W/Y=20N:70N/palette=centered/level=c  rose[g=gfine@AVE]

message

! Gridded data fields often exist on grids with unequally spaced points.
! The subsampled Levitus climatology provided with FERRET is an example
! of such a data set.

! We will plot the upper 100 meters of temperature at several arbitrary
! lat./long. positions and indicate the points with a large marker ("2").
! The unequal spacing of the point along the depth axis is apparent.

! Note:  "SHOW GRID/Z=0:100 temp"   could be used to list the exact depths.

SET DATA levitus_climatology
PLOT/X=140W/Z=0:100/LINE/SYMBOL=2 temp[Y=20N], temp[Y=10N], temp[Y=0]

message

! Suppose we require this data every 5 meters in the vertical.
! We can define a grid to acheive this.

DEFINE AXIS/Z=0:5000:5/UNIT=meters z5
DEFINE GRID/LIKE=temp/Z=z5  gz5

! The "LIKE=temp" ensures that the original X and Y axes will be preserved.

! Now we'll plot the original "curves" and overlay the regridded values.

LET tempz5 = temp[g=gz5]
PLOT/X=140W/Z=0:100 temp[Y=20N], temp[Y=10N], temp[Y=0]
PLOT/OVERLAY/SYMBOLS/X=140W/Z=0:100 tempz5[Y=20N], tempz5[Y=10N], tempz5[Y=0]

! Note that the LIST command could be used to obtain these results in a file.

message

! A common need for regridding is to compare variables from different
! data  sets.
! As a test case we will examine sea surface temperature fields from 2
! different sources: Esbensen-Kushnir and COADS
! First we will shade Esbensen-Kushnir sst and overlay the COADS sst in
! the North Pacific.

SET DATA esku_heat_budget, coads_climatology
SET REGION/Y=0:70N/X=130E:60W
SHADE/T="15-JAN"           sst[d=esku_heat_budget]
GO land
CONTOUR/OVERLAY/T="15-JAN" sst[d=coads_climatology]

message

! Clearly, the two fields are similar.
! We would like to subtract them to examine the differences.
! Unfortunately the two fields are on different grids.
! The SHOW GRID command will next be used to compare the latitudes of sst
! grid points between 1 and 5 degrees north from each data set:

!	SHOW GRID/Y=1N:5N sst[d=esku_heat_budget] sst[d=coads_climatology]

message

SHOW GRID/Y=1N:5N sst[d=esku_heat_budget] sst[d=coads_climatology]
message

! Now we will use the grid from the COADS data set to regrid the 
! Esbensen-Kushnir sst to the (finer) COADS grid. And shade the difference 
! field using a zero-centered color palette.

LET DIFF = sst[d=esku_heat_budget,g=sst[d=coads_climatology]] - sst[d=coads_climatology]
SHADE/T="15-JAN"/LEVELS=(-3,3,0.5) diff
palette saz2
GO land

message

! What happens when the dimensionality of variables differs ?
! As a test case lets examine the US Navy Fleet Numerical winds.
! We will use the earth surface relief to create land masses.

! Note:  "Using every 2th vector in the X direction" is an
! informational message from FERRET.

set data monthly_navy_winds
shade/lev="(0)(8000)"/nokey rose[d=etopo120]
vector/l=1/over uwnd,vwnd

message

! How can we eliminate the wind values over the land ?
! The earth relief data should allow us to do this.
! However the winds are defined at different latitude/longitude
! points from the earth relief.
! Also ==> "uwnd" (and "vwnd") has discrete time locations whereas 
!          "rose" is time-independent.

message

SHOW GRID   rose[d=etopo120] 

SHOW GRID   uwnd[d=monthly_navy_winds]
message

! If we request "rose[g=fnoc251]" FERRET will flag an error because the
! "rose" cannot be unambiguously located on a time axis.
! To obtain "rose" on the latitude/longitude points of "uwnd" we define
! a new grid which is like "uwnd" but keeps the (normal) time axis
! of the variable "rose".
 
DEFINE GRID/LIKE=uwnd[d=monthly_navy_winds]/T=rose[d=etopo120] gmask

message

! Then we will use this grid to create a land mask.
! And use the mask to vector plot the winds only over the oceans.

LET ocean = if rose[d=etopo120,g=gmask] le 0 then 1
