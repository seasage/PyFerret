! * * * *  PALETTES  * * * *
! As of Ferret version 5 there are 3 types of palettes:
! PERCENT, BY_LEVELS, and BY_VALUES. All palettes consist
! of a list of RGB color values and associated with each
! RGB value another value that determines how to map the color
! onto the "Z axis" of the plot. Previous to V5 all palettes
! behaved like PERCENT palettes.

! Note: from the Unix prompt you can use 
!	Fpalette '*'
! to see the available palettes.

! A PERCENT palette is an ordered sequence of RGB values
! representing a piecewise continuous path through color space.
! For a given plot with N contour levels the set of discrete colors
! used are determined by interpolating to N-1 equally spaced points
! along this path.

! From the Unix prompt try, for example, 
! 	Fpalette -more rbn2
! to see an example of a PERCENT palette file.

! Here are examples using a PERCENT palette:
PALETTE rainbow
ppl list shaset

set view upper; go magnify 1.2
FILL/levels=10 temp[z=0]; go land thick

set view lower; go magnify 1.2
FILL/lev=20 temp[z=0]; go land thick
\pause; set window/clear

PALETTE magma
ppl list shaset

set view upper; go magnify 1.2
FILL/levels=10 temp[z=0]; go land thick

set view lower; go magnify 1.2
FILL/lev=20 temp[z=0]; go land thick
\pause; set window/clear

! -----------------
! A BY_LEVELS palette specifies a list of invariant RGB color.
! The colors given in the list are exactly the colors that will be
! used on the plot -- no interpolation of colors is used. This is
! particularly useful for hard copy, where printers may be "fussy"
! about which colors look best. If the number of colors required
! for the plot exceeds the number given in the palette the
! colors are repeated starting from the first color as necessary.
! Note that this is the same logic used for pattern files.

! From the Unix prompt try, for example, 
! 	Fpalette -more rainbow_by_levels
! to see an example of a BY_LEVELS palette file.

! Here are examples using a BY_LEVELS palette:
PALETTE rainbow_by_levels
ppl list shaset

set view upper; go magnify 1.2
FILL/levels=(15,30,2.5) temp[z=0]; go land thick

set view lower; go magnify 1.2
FILL/lev=(15,30,.5) temp[z=0]; go land thick
\pause; set window/clear


! --------------------
! A BY_VALUE palette specifies a path through color
! space, much as does a PERCENT palette. However, the logic
! used to interpolate colors along the path is based on
! the data values of the the contour levels. With such a palette 
! the color representing, say, 25 degree temperature
! will be the same whether the temperature range on the
! plot is large or small and whether 25 degrees lies at the lower
! end of the range or the upper.

! From the Unix prompt try, for example, 
! 	Fpalette -more ocean_temp
! to see an example of a BY_VALUE palette file.

! In this example, using a BY_VALUE palette, we see
! sequence of ocean temperature plots at increasing depth.
! Note how the colors adjust themselves to the temperature values.

PALETTE ocean_temp
ppl list shaset

set view up; go magnify 1.5
FILL/Z=0 temp; go land thick

set view mid; go magnify 1.5
FILL/Z=50 temp; go land thick

set view low; go magnify 1.5
FILL/Z=200 temp; go land thick
\pause
