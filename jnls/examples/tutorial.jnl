! *************** Mini-tutorial on program FERRET  ******************

! This demonstration/tutorial will introduce the basic capabilities
! of the FERRET program through examples.

! As the demonstration runs please continue to read the text on the screen.
! You will see exactly the commands that are controlling the FERRET program.
! Lines that begin with "!" are comment lines - for your information only.

SET WINDOW/size=1.5/ASPECT=.75:axis   ! default aspect

! Suppose we want to plot values of 1/i for the first 10 integers
! i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
! We can do that with the following command:

PLOT/i=1:10  1/i

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE 

! We can change the aspect ratio of the plot to a more pleasing size and
! shape and re-draw the plot

SET WINDOW/size=1.5/ASPECT=0.5
PLOT/i=1:10  1/i

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! We can do the plot with marker symbols instead of a smooth curve:
! and request a white background

GO white
PLOT/i=1:10/SYMBOLS  1/i

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! We can define a new variable, "inverse", and give it a title of our
! choosing.  In this plot we use both custom plot marks and a line and
! we specify the vertical plotting axis range.

LET/TITLE="My inverse of I" iinverse = 1/i
PLOT/i=1:10/SYMBOLS=2/LINE/VLIMITS=-1:2:0.25  iinverse

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! We can combine several functions on the same plot

PLOT/i=1:10   1/i, 1/(i+3), 1/i + 1/(10-i)

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Now in a single window we will plot all of the preceding graphs again.
! The parts of the window are called "viewports".
! They are named UL, for "upper left", LL, LR, and UR, similarly.

SET VIEWPORT UL
PLOT/i=1:10  1/i
SET VIEWPORT LL
PLOT/i=1:10/SYMBOLS  1/i
SET VIEWPORT LR
PLOT/i=1:10/SYMBOLS=2/LINE/VLIMITS=-1:2:0.25  iinverse
SET VIEWPORT UR
PLOT/i=1:10   1/i, 1/(i+3), 1/i + 1/(10-i)

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Other forms of graphics are also available.
! Here we are just playing with simple 2-dimensional mathematical functions

! Contouring ...

WIRE/VIEWPOINT=-4,-10,4 gauss
SET GRID ABSTRACT		! restore default grid for demos that follow

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Now we will look at some actual data.

! To begin we inform FERRET of the "data set" of interest using the
! SET DATA command.  The ETOPO60 data set contains the relief of the
! surface of the earth 

SET DATA etopo60

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE 

! We can query FERRET for the contents of the data set with the SHOW DATA
! command.  The output of SHOW DATA immediately follows the command, below.

SHOW DATA

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! What we see is a single variable, "ROSE", and its 4-dimensional limits.
! The letters I,J,K and L refer to its limits along the X,Y,Z, and T axes,
! respectively.  ROSE is a 2-dimensional variable;  it exists in the XY
! (latitude-longitude) plane.

! Lets look at a shaded plot of the earth's relief.
! Since we don't specify any limits the full extent of the data
! will be used.

SHADE  ROSE

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Or we can zoom in on North America (long. 160W:40W, lat. 20N:70N)
! using a 500 meter vertical resolution and a filled-contour plot.

FILL/X=160W:40W/Y=20N:70N/level=(-7000,4000,500) ROSE

! ... and overlay the continental boundaries  

GO land 0  

! The "0" above specifies pen color zero (black) for the continents.
! The GO command, as you have been seeing, can run "scripts" to perform a
! wide variety of tasks.  Go scripts are files of ordinary FERRET commands.

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Now lets turn our attention to another data set: 
! the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data SET ("COADS")

SET  DATA coads_climatology
SHOW DATA coads_climatology

! As you can see there are a number of variables and there are 12 points
! on the time (L) axis.

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Within FERRET "variables" are always defined on "grids";  "grids" are always
! composed of 1 to 4 "axes"; and "axes" are composed of numerous points.
 
! We can query FERRET to learn more about the grid and axes upon which
! the variable SST is defined using the SHOW GRID command.
! (The output of "SHOW GRID SST" follows the command.)

SHOW GRID SST

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! We can further enquire about the coordinates of axis points by specifying
! which axis and what range of values we are interested in.
! For example,  (the output of "SHOW GRID/L=1:4 SST" follows the command)

SHOW GRID/L=1:4 SST

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! OK.  Now lets use the SHADE command to make a color shaded plot of the
! sea surface temperature at the first time step.

SHADE/L=1 SST

! And overlay "filled" continents instead of an outline
GO fland

! Notice the black regions where there are gaps in the COADS data set

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Just as simply we can look at the air-sea temperature difference.

SHADE/L=1 AIRT-SST
GO fland        ! overlay "filled" continents

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! And we can overlay a vector arrow plot of the surface winds, too.

VECTOR/OVERLAY/L=1 UWND, VWND

! The combination of high wind speeds and large air-sea temperature
! difference suggests some regions of the worlds oceans where the 
! sensible heat exchange is very large - for example off the Atlantic
! coast of North America.

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! A thought exercise to the viewer:

! If sensible heat exchange can be computed by the equation
!      QSENS = COEF * WSPD * (AIRT-SST)
! where WSPD is the COADS wind speed and COEF is an arbitrary coefficient

! 1> How would you produce a shaded plot of QSENS at L=1 ?

! 2> How would you produce a time series plot for all 12 months at a point
!    of your choosing in the North Atlantic ?
 
! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! OK. Lets look at the annual variation of the sea surface temperature
! by displaying the four seasons on a single plot.

SET VIEW Ul
SHADE/L=3 sst
SET VIEW UR
SHADE/L=6 sst
SET VIEW LL
SHADE/L=9 sst
SET VIEW LR
SHADE/L=12 sst

! It is difficult to pick out the differences in the fields, isn't it ?

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! FERRET has many ways to help you explore this kind of problem.
! Lets begin by looking at the average over all 12 time steps.
! We do this with the "AVE" transformation applied to the time axis.

! "SHADE/LINE" tells FERRET to overlay contour lines instead of
! putting a color key on the plot.

CANCEL VIEWPORTS
SHADE/LINE SST[L=1:12@AVE]

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Now lets look at how the first time step differs from this average.
! We will use a color palette that emphasizes which regions are
! positive and which are negative.

! Notice that the plot is for January.  The northern hemisphere is in
! winter - hence colder than the annual average.  The opposite is true
! in the southern hemisphere.

SHADE/PALETTE=saz2 SST[L=1] - SST[L=1:12@AVE]
GO fland

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Now lets look at the four seasons ae we did before - but this
! time plotting the anomaly from the annual average field.

LET SST_AVE  = SST[L=1:12@AVE]
LET/TITLE="SST Anomaly"    SST_ANOM = SST - SST_AVE

SET VIEW Ul
SHADE/L=3/LEVELS=(-14)(-5,5,1)(14) sst_anom
SET VIEW UR
SHADE/L=6/LEVELS=(-14)(-5,5,1)(14) sst_anom
SET VIEW LL
SHADE/L=9/LEVELS=(-14)(-5,5,1)(14) sst_anom
SET VIEW LR
SHADE/L=12/LEVELS=(-14)(-5,5,1)(14) sst_anom

! The contour levels were chosen to emphasize the variations.


! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Digression:
! An effective way to visualize the annual variations of SST would be as
! an animation.  It is a simple matter for FERRET to create an animation.
! After this tutorial try these commands to make a movie of 12 sst months.

! 	yes? SET DATA coads_climatology
! 	yes? SET MOVIE/FILE=my_animation.mgm
!	yes? REPEAT/l=1:12 SHADE/FRAME sst_anom    ! save frames in your file
!	yes? ANIMATE

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Lets focus our attention at a particular longitude, say, X=180, the
! International Dateline.  We can get an accurate picture of the SST
! changes there by producing a 2-dimensional view along the Y and T axes.
! We will use the SET REGION command to confine ourselves to X=180.

! We leave the existing window on the screen as a reference and send the
! new output to a separate window.
! (If the new window overlaps the old you can use your mouse to separate them)

SET REGION/X=180
SET WINDOW/size=1.5/NEW
FILL/Y=70S:70N/L=1:48/LEVELS=(-7,7,1) SST_ANOM

! The time axis of this data set is referred to as a "modulo" axis
! - that is, the first month follows the last.  So the L=1:48 qualifier
! repeats the data over 4 cycles in time - emphasizing its cyclic nature.

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! Our plot shows the expected out of phase behavior between north and south.

! Lets summarize the results by averaging separately within the northern
! and southern temperate zones (23.5 to 65 degrees latitude).
! We can then plot the two time series that result.

! We will put the results into the first window so they can easily be
! compared to the last shaded drawing.

SET WINDOW/CLEAR/ASPECT=0.4/size=1.5 1
CANCEL VIEWPORTS
LET NORTH = SST_ANOM[Y=23.5N:65N@AVE]
LET SOUTH = SST_ANOM[Y=65S:23.5S@AVE]
PLOT/L=1:48 NORTH, SOUTH

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! We can list the first 5 months to the screen with the LIST command below.

LIST/L=1:5 NORTH, SOUTH

! Sending the listed results to a file (with a variety of formats) 
! requires only the addition of "/FILE=filename".

! ******************************************************************** 
MESSAGE

! This tutorial is now completed.

! You have been shown numerous capabilities of FERRET:
! line, contour, vector and shaded plots;
! multiple viewports, and windows; color controls;
! abstract mathematical functions, data from data sets, and new
! variables defined from old ones;
! transformations and plots along various axes.

! You have only scratched the surface.
