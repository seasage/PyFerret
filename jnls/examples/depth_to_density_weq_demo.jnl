! Description: show contour with a user-defined variable as an axis

! This FERRET script demonstrates a technique for using a user-defined variable
! as an axis of a FERRET variable for purposes of plotting, listing or
! calculations

! Notes:
! 1) The technique will not work on 4D variables - ony 1D, 2D, and 3D
! 2) If the translation from the independent axis to the user-defined
!    (dependent) variable is constant with respect to the other axes then the
!    desired result can be achieved much more simply using regridding by
!    association (g=@ASN).
!    e.g. To display depth in cm instead of meters:
!         DEFINE AXIS/Z=lo:hi:delta/unit=cm zcm   ! match z in meters pt for pt
!         DEFINE GRID/LIKE=my_var/Z=zcm  gcm
!         CONTOUR my_var[g=gcm@ASN]

! The strategy used in this script may be more difficult to understand in
! words than by example.  Both follow.

! This script uses the following strategy:
! 1) define a grid (gdens) which replaces one of the unused dimensions of your
!    variable with the desired axis (axdens) of (dependent) values
! 2) by subtracting the new axis coordinates from the dependent variable
!    define a new variable (r0) which at each point of the new axis is 
!    exactly zero where the dependent value equals the coordinate value. 
!    (Effectively this replicates the original dependent field at each
!    point of the new axis and then subtracts the coordinate value at each
!    point.  The resulting N+1 dimensional field will always have a value of
!    zero where the coordinate equals the original unreplicated value)
! 3) Create an expression (r0[z=@weq:0]) which when multiplied by the variable
!    you wish to plot (temp) and summed along its original independent axis
!    will produce the value of temp at the point where the dependent
!    axis coordinate equals the dependent variable field.
! 4) Multiply and sum to produce the desired result.
! 5) (Manually invert the depth axis direction if appropriate)
 
! In this example we will produce a contour plot of temperature along the
! equator in the Tropical Pacific Ocean using axes of longitude and density.
! The dependent variable, dens (density), will replace the independent axis,
! depth.

! use the Levitus climatology along the equator in the Pacific Ocean
set data levitus_climatology
set region/y=0/x=130e:80w/z=0:1000

set window/size=1.5

! define a new variable for density (dens) and contour it just for a look
let/title=density dens = rho_un(salt,temp,z)
contour/color=blue dens
message/quiet  ! pause to look at the plot

! in a new grid replace the unused T axis of "temp" with the density axis
define axis/t=1022:1032:1/unit="density" axdens
define grid/like=temp/t=axdens gdens

! define a new variable, r0, with a value of zero wherever dens equals its
! coordinate on the density axis  (r0 is a 4-dimensional variable with 
! density in the T axis slot)
let r0 = dens[l=1] - t[g=gdens]

! define a new variable, ktemp, which, when summed along the Z axis, will give
! the (single) value of temp at the location where dens equals its own
! coordinate on the density axis 
let ktemp = r0[z=@weq:0] * temp[l=1]

! contour the new variable summed (integrated) along the Z axis
! ( Since the Z axis reduces to a point in this operation the result is 3D - 
!   longitude, latitude and density with latitude fixed at Y=0) 
contour/color=blue/t=1022:1032 ktemp[z=@sum]
message/quiet  ! pause to look at the plot

! reverse the vertical (density) axis so it looks conventional
ppl yaxis 1032,1022,-1
