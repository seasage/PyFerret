! This FERRET journal file presents examples of reading data from a file.
! The file SNOOPY.DAT is distributed with the FERRET demo data sets
! It contains 50 records with 6 columns of data.
!	Columns 1,3,5 are variable number 1
!	Columns 2,4,6 are variable number 2
! (The FERRET Users Guide has additional  examples.)

! Our first file access will be as simple as possible - we will rely strictly
! on defaults.  FERRET will by default access only the first column and will
! name it "v1"

FILE snoopy.dat
show data

PLOT v1
pause 

! Now we will access all the data by telling FERRET there are 2 variables
! located in 6 columns.

FILE/VARIABLES="my_var1,my_var2"/COLUMNS=6 snoopy.dat
PLOT my_var1,my_var2
show data
pause 

! Just for the heck of it lets add the two variables together.
PLOT my_var1+my_var2

pause 

! And just for the heck of it lets grab columns 3 and 4, only.

FILE/VARIABLES="my_var1,my_var2"/FORMAT=(21X,F14.0,F8.0) snoopy.dat
PLOT my_var1,my_var2

pause 

! Now suppose that the data, instead, represent a 2D grid with
! 6 longitudes by 50 latitudes

DEFINE AXIS/X=10e:60e:10/unit=degree xlong
DEFINE AXIS/Y=0:49n:1/unit=degree y50
DEFINE GRID/x=xlong/y=y50 gsnoopy2D
! By default only one column will be read.  The /COLUMNS= tells FERRET how many
FILE/VARIABLES=my_2D_var/COLUMNS=6/GRID=gsnoopy2D snoopy.dat
contour my_2D_var

pause 

! or suppose it was a time series of 10 lat/long grids - each grid
! having 6 longitudes by 5 latitudes

DEFINE AXIS/Y=0:40n:10/unit=degree y5
DEFINE AXIS/T=1-jan-1981:10-jan-1981:1/unit=day t10
DEFINE GRID/x=xlong/y=y5/t=t10 gsnoopy3D
FILE/VARIABLES=my_3D_var/COLUMNS=6/GRID=gsnoopy3D snoopy.dat
contour/Y=10N my_3D_var
