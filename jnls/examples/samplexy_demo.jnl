! Description: Use the SAMPLEXY function to create an arbitrary 2D 
! vertical section from a 3D field. The result has the same depth
! axis as the variable being sampled.  The horizontal axis is abstract; 
! it is a count of the number of points along the track.  


! Here is a section of the Levitus climatological temperature running
! along a track defined by points (xlon, xlat), which could also be
! read from a file.
