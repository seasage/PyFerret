! Description: explores the Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean

! This demonstration explores the Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean, 
! actually a subset of it, compiled by Sydney Levitus.  The present data set
! contains the annual average value of ocean temperature and salinity at 20
! levels to 5000 meters, over the world ocean.

! Advanced use of FERRET commands in the demo will give you helpful examples
! of their use.  See the User's Guide for more on individual commands.

! Or, looking at the structure of the temperature field more closely --

SHADE/K=1/LEV=(-2,32,1) TEMP

! You can note --
!	The `cold tongue' in the eastern equatorial Pacific, the western 
!	Pacific equatorial warm pool, the effects of the gulf stream in the 
!	NE Atlantic at about 60 North and that in the subtropics surface
!	temperatures are greater in the west than in the east.

MESSAGE

SHADE/K=1 SALT

MESSAGE

! The levels chosen for salinity are not the best -- let's change them

SHADE/K=1/LEV=(0,49,3)(33,37,.4) SALT

! In surface salinity you can note --
!	Higher salinity in the centers of the subtropical gyres.
!	The difference in salinity between the Mediterranean and the Baltic.
!	Low salinity in river outflows: the Amazon, Congo and Ganges.

MESSAGE

! Now overlay the two fields and outline the land masses

! The relationship between surface temperature and salinity is not simple.

! for comparison

! Note at 200 meters temperature and salinity are more closely related.

! And now a meridional slice -- first in the Atlantic

FILL/X=30W/LEV=(-2,32,2) TEMP
CONTOUR/OVER/X=30W/LEV=(0,49,3)(33,37,.4) SALT

! The warm subtropical gyres are evident here; there is correlation between
! temperature and salinity, and note the Antarctic Intermediate Water's 
! strong signal in salinity near 60 South at the surface, extending 
! equatorward around 1000 meters.

MESSAGE

! And then in the Pacific

FILL/X=180W/LEV=(-2,32,2) TEMP
CONTOUR/OVER/X=180W/LEV=(0,49,3)(33,37,.4) SALT

MESSAGE

! T-S diagrams may be constructed with a single "sounding"

PLOT/VS/LINE/X=20W/Y=35N SALT,TEMP

! Illustrating the general monotonic decrease of temperature with depth.  This
! is in general true of salinity too but note here around 10 degrees Celsius 
! salinity increases -- due to inflow at depth into the Atlantic of
! higher salinity Mediterranean water.
