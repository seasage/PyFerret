say Ribbon plots are line plots colored by a variable. 
say These may be 3-variable PLOT/VS plots, colored by the third argument


say . RIBBON/VS/LEV= xpts, ypts, var
say . 
say . or 2-variable line plot, colored by the second argument
say . RIBBON/LEV= var1, var2
say . 
say . The alias RIBBON is shorthand for PLOT/RIBBON

say We can even plot a variable, colored by itself. 
say Notice here that the /LEVELS and /PALETTE qualifiers are
say applied in the same way as for any 2-dimensonal color plot.

say We just defined some variables to plot. These will be 
say PLOT/VS plots, where the plot is colored by a third variable.
say
say By default, colors are blended from one point to the next, with the 
say color right at the point corresponding to the value at that point.
say If we plot with /SYMBOL, the symbols will be colored by the exact color
say for the variable at that point.
say
say The /FAST qualifier draws a plot without this blending. The color 
say for the point extends from the start of the grid cell to the end 
say of the grid cell.

say Plot with /LINE/SYMBOL to show both the points and the line between them
